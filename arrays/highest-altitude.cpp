//link: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-highest-altitude/

/*There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of n + 1 points at various altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point 0 with altitude equal 0.

You are given an integer array gain of length n where gain[i] is the net gain in altitude between points i​​​​​​ and i + 1 for all (0 <= i < n). Return the highest altitude of a point.

 

Example 1:

Input: gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]
Output: 1
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]. The highest is 1.
Example 2:

Input: gain = [-4,-3,-2,-1,4,3,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-4,-7,-9,-10,-6,-3,-1]. The highest is 0.
 

Constraints:

n == gain.length
1 <= n <= 100
-100 <= gain[i] <= 100*/

int largestAltitude(vector<int>& gain) {
        int highest=0, elem;
        vector<int> alt;
        alt.push_back(0);
        int n=gain.size();

        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            elem=alt[i-1]+gain[i-1];
            alt.push_back(elem);
            if(elem>highest){
                highest=elem;
            }
        }
        return highest;
    }
